<div class="blockquot"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <span class="smcap">Gerald’s</span> <i>rooms in Grafton Street. A man’s room, pleasantly
furnished, with very comfortable arm-chairs, and prints on the
walls. Books are lying about, and smoking utensils.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Charles</span>, <span class="smcap">Gerald Halstane’s</span> <i>servant, opens the door</i>. <span class="smcap">Mr. Wright</span>
<i>comes in, a dapper young man, smartly dressed</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>There, you can see for yourself that Mr. Halstane is not at home.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright.</span></p>

<p>Very well, I’ll wait for him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>You’ll have to wait till midnight, because I don’t expect him in.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright.</span></p>

<p>Last time I came you said he’d be back in half an<a name="page_2" id="page_2"></a> hour, and when I
returned you said he’d just gone out. You don’t catch me napping a
second time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>The governor don’t take impertinence lying down, Mr. Wright, and he’ll
look upon it as a great liberty your dunning him in this way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know about taking impertinence, but he’ll have to take a summons
if my account is not settled at once.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a ring at the bell.</i></p></div>

<p>[<i>Ironically.</i>] Make yourself quite at home, won’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>No, sir. He’s gone to his club.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rixon.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’ll ring him up. I must see him on a matter of the very greatest
importance. You’re on the telephone, aren’t you?<a name="page_3" id="page_3"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir. But there’s a person waiting to see him.</p>

<p>[<i>Coming in.</i>] Oh, never mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Rixon</span> <i>is a short, rubicund man, with white whiskers and a hearty

<p>[<i>Going towards him.</i>] Mr. Rixon. [<span class="smcap">Rixon</span> <i>looks at him without
recognising him</i>.] Don’t you remember me, sir? I’m the junior partner in
Andrews and Wright.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rixon.</span></p>

<p>Of course I do. I saw your father on business the other day. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smcap">Charles</span>.] Where’s the telephone book?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>I’ll just go and fetch it, sir. Mr. Halstane lent it to the gentleman
upstairs.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rixon.</span></p>

<p>Be as quick as you can.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rixon.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Wright</span>.] What are you doing here?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright.</span></p>

<p>Well, the fact is, we’ve got a very large account with Halstane, and I’m
told he’s in queer street. I want to get the money before the crash
comes.<a name="page_4" id="page_4"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rixon.</span></p>

<p>Queer street? The man’s just come into seven thousand a year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright.</span></p>

<p>What!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rixon.</span></p>

<p>That’s why I’m running all over the place to find him. You know he’s a
relation of the Hollingtons. I was at her ladyship’s not half an hour
ago&mdash;the Dowager, you know&mdash;my firm has acted for the whole family for
the last hundred years. Well, I’d hardly arrived before a message came
from the War Office to say that her grandson, the present lord, had been
killed in India. So as soon as I could, I bolted round here. Mr.
Halstane is the next heir, and he comes into seven thousand a year and
the title.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright.</span></p>

<p>My gracious, that’s a piece of luck.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rixon.</span></p>

<p>I don’t mind telling you now that he’d pretty well come to the end of
his tether. Your money was all right because he’d have paid everything
up, but he wouldn’t have had much left.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright.</span></p>

<p>Of course he doesn’t know anything about this yet?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Rixon.</span></p>

<p>Not a word. For all he knows, he’s a ruined man, and here am I trying to
get him on the telephone to<a name="page_5" id="page_5"></a> tell him he’s come into a peerage and a
very handsome income.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>enters with the telephone book</i>.</p></div>

<p>7869 Gerrard, please, Miss.... What? Confound it, the line’s engaged....
I must go round to his club in a cab. I suppose you don’t want to wait
here now, Wright?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mr. Wright.</span></p>

<p>No, sir. I’ll get back to the shop.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>I ’ope you’ll suit your own convenience, sir. [<span class="smcap">Charles</span> <i>shows them out

when they expect gentlemen to pay their bills.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, sir; I didn’t hear you come in.</p>

<p>[<i>With an ironical politeness which he preserves during all his remarks

myself if I think I’ve interrupted your nap.</p>

<p>Shall I take your hat, sir?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>It’s very kind of you. I shouldn’t like you to put yourself out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sitting down.</i>] By Jove, what a ripping chair! No wonder that Charles
went to sleep.</p>

<p>[<i>With a laugh.</i>] I’m not sorry to miss him. One’s solicitor seldom has
any good news to bring one.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Will you have the whiskey and soda, sir?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>If you can spare me two minutes of your valuable time, I should like to
make a few observations to you.</p>

<p>Collect yourself, Charles, to receive the words of wisdom that fall from
Mr. Halstane’s lips.<a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Things is very bad on the Stock Exchange, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Charles, I have no objection to your sitting in my arm-chair and putting
your feet on my table. I am willing to ignore the fact that you smoke my
cigars and drink my whiskey.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sipping.</i>] You show excellent judgment, Charles. The whiskey’s
capital.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Imperturbably.</i>] Pot-still, sir. Fifteen years in bottle.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I can even bear with equanimity that you should read my letters. For the
most part they’re excessively tedious, and they will only show you how
deplorable is the education of the upper classes. But I must insist on
your <i>not</i> reading my paper till I’ve done with it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>I’m very sorry, sir. I thought there was no objection.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>A newspaper, a suit of clothes, and a bottle of wine are three things at
which I prefer....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>To ’ave the first cut in, sir.<a name="page_9" id="page_9"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I thank you, Charles; I couldn’t have expressed my meaning more
idiomatically.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] You’d better have a drink.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Allow me, sir.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He mixes a whiskey and soda.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You need not pour out the whiskey with such a generous hand as when you
help yourself. Thank you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Them mining shares of yours is very low, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>They are.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>If you’ll remember, sir, I was all against them at the time you bought.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You are a jewel, Charles, if besides administering to your master’s
wants you advise him in his financial transactions.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Unless I’m mistaken, Charles strongly recommended me to invest my money
in public-houses.<a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a></p>

<p>Them being frequented in peace and war, and not subject to clandestine
removals. In peace men drink to celebrate their ’appiness, and in war to
drown their sorrow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] You are a philosopher, Charles, and it cuts me to the quick
that I should be forced to deny myself the charm of your conversation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Astonished.</i>] I beg your pardon, sir?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I am endeavouring to give you notice in such a manner as not to outrage
your susceptibilities.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Me, sir? I’m sorry if I don’t give satisfaction.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>On the contrary, you give every satisfaction. It has never been my good
fortune to run across a servant who had an equal talent for blacking
boots and for repartee. I am grateful for the care with which you have
kept my wardrobe, and the encouragement you have offered to my attempts
at humour. I have never seen you perturbed by a rebuke, or discouraged
by ill-temper. Your merits, in fact, are overwhelming, but I’m afraid I
must ask you to find another place.<a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You really shouldn’t be so abrupt, Gerald. Look at him staggering under
the blow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>I’m very comfortable here, sir. Can you give me no reason for this
decision?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You gave it yourself, Charles. As you justly observed, them mining
shares is very low. You are sufficiently acquainted with my
correspondence to be aware that my creditors have passed with singular
unanimity from the stage of remonstrance to that of indignation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I say, I’m sorry to hear this, old man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>If it’s just a matter of wages, sir, I shall be ’appy to wait till it
suits your convenience to pay me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile of thanks.</i>] I’m grateful to you for that, Charles; but,
honestly, do you think half-measures can be of any use to me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, so far as I’m acquainted with your circumstances....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Come, come, this modesty ill becomes you. Is<a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a> there a bill in this room,
or a solicitor’s letter, with which you are not intimately acquainted?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, if you ask me outright&mdash;things is pretty bad.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I say, don’t play the ass any more. What the deuce does it all mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry the manner in which I’m imparting to you an interesting piece
of information, doesn’t meet with your approval. Would you like me to
tear my hair in handfuls?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>It would be picturesque, but painful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Are you really broke?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>So much so that I’ve to-day sublet my rooms. In a week, Charles, I shall
cast the dust of London off my feet, a victim to the British custom of
primogeniture.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Have you the least idea what I mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>No, sir.<a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Well, I feel certain that during some of the many leisure moments you
have enjoyed in my service, you have cast an eye upon that page in Burke
upon which my name figures&mdash;insignificantly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Begging your pardon, sir, I looked you up in the Peerage before I
accepted the situation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>It rejoices me to learn that your investigations were satisfactory.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, always having lived before with titled gentlemen, I felt I
owed it to myself to be careful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I am overpowered by your condescension, Charles. It never occurred to me
that you were taking my character while I was taking yours.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>If servants wanted as good characters from masters as masters want from
servants, I ’ave an idea that many gentlemen would ’ave to clean their
own boots.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You scintillate, Charles, but I deplore your tendency to digress.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>I beg pardon, sir. As you was the second son of<a name="page_14" id="page_14"></a> an honourable and very
well connected, I didn’t mind stretching a point. If I may say so, your
father was almost a nobleman.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>The consequence is, however, that I was brought up without in the least
knowing how to earn my living. I belong to that vast army of younger
sons whose sole means of livelihood is a connection with a peer of the
realm and such mother-wit as Dame Nature has provided them with.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>A ring is heard.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Charles.</span></p>

<p>There’s some one at the door, sir. Are you at home?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>No, I expect two ladies to tea in half an hour, but you must admit no
one else. These gentlemen will be forced to deprive me of their society
in twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Not at all. Not at all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I repeat with considerable firmness that these gentlemen will be
compelled by a previous engagement to leave me in <i>twenty</i> minutes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>It’ll be difficult after that to make our departure seem perfectly

would certainly never stay in a house where he’d been so grossly

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I love shocking Charles. He’s so genteel. Whenever I come here I see him

<p>I’ve been lunching with Blenkinsop. I answered about fifty begging
letters before I came out this morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Gerald</span>.] You’ve not said you’re glad to see me yet.</p>

<p>I’m not sure that I am, very.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Not at all disconcerted.</i>] Then say you like my frock.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Yes, it’s very nice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Very nice! I should think it was very nice. There’s no one in London
who’d venture to wear anything half so outrageous. And as for the
hat....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>The hat’s hideous. But I suppose it’s fashionable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My dear James, where were you educated?<a name="page_19" id="page_19"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>At Eton.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, they taught you nothing about clothes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I wish sometimes that nice women wouldn’t get themselves up as if they
were no better than they should be.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be so absurd. The ideal of a woman who takes any pains about her
frocks is to look as like an abandoned hussy as she possibly can.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot</span> <i>chooses the most comfortable chair in the room</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid I can’t ask you to sit down.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don’t trouble. I’m perfectly capable of doing that of my own
accord.... If you think I’m going before you’ve answered a hundred and
fifty questions you’re very much mistaken. First, I want to know why
you’ve not been near me for the last week? Then why you try to keep me
out of the place? And lastly, why you show every desire to get rid of me
when I’m here?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’ve not seen you because I’ve been uncommonly busy. I said I was not at
home because I’m in the<a name="page_20" id="page_20"></a> worst possible temper. And I want to get rid of
you because I’m expecting somebody else.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I suppose if I were a thoroughly tactful person I should now ring for my
carriage?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I daresay you would ask me to ring for it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, I shall neither do the one nor the other. In the first place your
answers are all nonsense and in the second I want to know who’s coming?
If it’s some one I know, I shall stop and say, How d’you do, and if it
isn’t I want to see what <i>it’s</i> like.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I suppose you know I’m perfectly capable of turning you out by main
force.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>If you touch me I shall scream.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Freddie, I quite forgot. I’ve got a pile of letters that I found on
my way out this afternoon. There are three poor clergymen who can’t pay
their bills, and there are five elderly spinsters who don’t know which
way to turn for their quarter’s rent, and<a name="page_21" id="page_21"></a> there are seven deserving
ladies with a starving husband each and sixteen children.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>How very immoral!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>It would be much more immoral if they had a starving child each and
sixteen husbands.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I suppose it’s never occurred to you that you do a great deal more harm
than good by your indiscriminate charity?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be such an old frump. If it gives me a certain amount of pleasure
to give money away, why on earth shouldn’t I? I daresay that nineteen
out of every twenty people I help are thoroughly worthless, but it’s
only by doing something for them all that I can be quite certain of not
missing the twentieth.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>D’you want me to write to them at once?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>This very minute.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] But that’ll only get rid of me, you know. Blenkinsop
will still be here.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coolly.</i>] James, do go and see that Freddie writes<a name="page_22" id="page_22"></a> his letters
nicely. He’s only just come down from Oxford, and his spelling is rather
shaky.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a grunt.</i>] You can give us a shout when you’ve had your talk.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Won’t you tell an old friend?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a very short pause.</i>] Nothing that you can help me in, Mrs. Dot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Won’t you leave the Mrs. out? It makes me feel so five and thirtyish.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You’re a ripping good sort, and we’ve had some charming times together.
I’m glad that you came<a name="page_23" id="page_23"></a> to-day, because it’s given me an opportunity to
thank you for all your kindness to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My dear boy, what <i>are</i> you talking about?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Well, the fact is, I’ve been spending a good deal of money lately, and
I’m rather broke.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>How stupid of me! I’ve always had such lots myself it never occurs to me
that any one else may be hard up. And I’ve let you pay all sorts of
things for me, theatres and dinners and heaven knows what. I must owe
you a perfect fortune.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense! You don’t owe me a penny.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well then, in future I insist on paying for everything. I’m not going to
give up our little dinners at the Savoy and our suppers and all the rest
of it. Don’t be so silly. You know I have ten times more money than I
know what to do with.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I can see you furtively slipping your purse into my hand so that I
should pay for a luncheon, and giving me a shilling over for the cab.
No, thank you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Then we’ll economise together. It only means<a name="page_24" id="page_24"></a> going to the pit of a
theatre instead of taking a box. Well, I like the pit much better. You
see all the women come in and you criticise their back hair. And you
suck delicious oranges all the time. It makes my mouth water to think of
it. And we’ll go on a bus instead of taking cabs. They’re much safer,
and I like sitting on the front seat and talking to the driver.
Bus-drivers are always such handsome men.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>It’s not a question of driving in buses, but of walking on my flat feet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Very well. You shall walk on your flat feet, and I’ll trip along by your
side on my arched instep.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Things have come to such a pass that I must either beg, steal, or work.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Then tell me exactly how matters stand.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>It would only bore you, and besides you wouldn’t understand.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Now you’re talking through your hat, my friend. You’re simply talking
through your hat. I flatter myself there are few men who have a better
head for business than I have. Why, since my husband died I’ve almost
doubled our profits. The brewery has<a name="page_25" id="page_25"></a> never been so flourishing. I’ve
told the British People on fifty thousand hoardings to drink Worthley’s
Half-crown Family Ale, and by Jove, the British People do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You funny little thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, now tell me all about it, and let’s see if things can’t be put
straight.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, I’m afraid they’re in a most awful mess. I never had much
money to start with, and I got into debt. Then I tried a flutter on the
Stock Exchange, and the confounded shares went down steadily from the
day I bought.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>It’s a way shares have when fools buy them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>But I daresay I could have weathered that, only a pal of mine got into a
hole, and I backed a bill for him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You don’t mean to say you did that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I was obliged to. I couldn’t let him go under without trying to do
something.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You donkey, you perfect donkey!<a name="page_26" id="page_26"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>He swore he’d be able to pay the money.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I never knew a man yet, or a woman either for that matter, who’d stick
at a thundering lie when he wanted money. And what’s the result?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Well, the result is that after I’ve paid everything up, I shall have
about five hundred pounds left. I’m proposing to go out to America and
rough it a bit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Pardon my asking, but do you think a handsome face, a talent for small
talk, and a certain charm of manner will enable you to earn your daily
bread?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] I don’t want to seem vain, but although I’ve done my best
to conceal them, I fancy I have two or three other qualifications which
will be of more service.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Then the long and the short of it is that you’re ruined.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Absolutely.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I’m delighted to hear it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Dot!<a name="page_27" id="page_27"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I am. I can’t help it. But I think your plan of going to the States is
simply foolish.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>What else <i>can</i> I do? The Cape’s entirely played out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You stupid creature.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I beg your pardon!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You belong to a class whose chief resource when it has squandered its
money is a rich marriage. The custom is so well recognised that when a
man of good family emigrates rather than have recourse to it, society is
outraged and suspicious.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Thanks. I don’t think I can see myself marrying for money.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be so absurd. I never heard that the course of true love ran any
less smoothly because a charming widow had sixty thousand a year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>What <i>do</i> you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My dear boy, I’m not a perfect fool. A man thinks<a name="page_28" id="page_28"></a> a woman never sees
anything unless she looks at it with both eyes at once wide open. Don’t
you know that she can see things through the back of her head with a
stone wall in between?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>What have you seen, then?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I’ve seen a thousand things. I’ve seen your eyes light up when I came
into the room, I’ve seen you watch me when you thought I wasn’t looking.
I’ve seen you scowl at any young fool who paid me an outrageous
compliment. I’ve seen the pleasure it gave you to do me any trifling
service. I’ve seen you watch for the opportunity of putting my cloak on
my shoulders after the play. And&mdash;I’m sorry&mdash;but I’ve come to the
conclusion that you’re in love with me. I dare say the fact has escaped
your notice, but that’s only because men are so deplorably stupid.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] D’you think it’s quite kind to laugh at me now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But I’m not laughing at you, my dear. I’m so pleased, and so flattered
and so touched. At first I thought I was only a fool, and that I saw
those things only because I wanted to. And when your hand trembled a
little as it took mine, I was afraid it was only my hand that was
trembling. And at last when I was certain that you were just as much in
love with me as I was with you, I was so glad that I cried<a name="page_29" id="page_29"></a> for two
hours. And I had to use a whole box of powder before I could make myself
presentable again.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Grimly.</i>] I’m afraid you’ll think me an utter brute. I ought to have
told you long ago that I’m engaged to be married.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Gerald!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been engaged to Nellie Sellenger for the last three years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Why didn’t you tell me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>No one was supposed to know anything about it. And&mdash;I was afraid of
losing you. Oh, Dot, Dot, I love you with all my heart. And I’m so glad
to be forced to tell you at last.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But I don’t understand in the least.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You know Nellie Sellenger is an old friend of mine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Yes, it was at the Sellengers’ I first met you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Well, three years ago we were staying at the same place in the country,
and I was a young fool.<a name="page_30" id="page_30"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You mean that there was no other girl there, and so you flirted with
her. But you need not have asked her to marry you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Apologetically.</i>] It was the merest accident. It came to pieces in my
’ands, so to speak.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>We were taking a walk in the garden after dinner, and a perfectly absurd
moon was shining. It seemed the obvious thing to do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>And of course she accepted. The girl of eighteen always does.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>But Lady Sellenger refused to hear of it. She thought me most
ineligible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Lady Sellenger’s a sensible woman. She was quite right.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’m not so sure. If she’d given us her blessing and told us to do as we
liked, we should probably have broken it off in three weeks. But she was
really rather offensive about it. She refused to let Nellie see me, and
the result was that we were<a name="page_31" id="page_31"></a> always running across one another in Bond
Street tea-shops.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Monstrous! And so bad for the digestion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Some time ago Lady Sellenger found out that we were writing to one
another and so on, so she came to see me and said she’d made up her mind
to take Nellie abroad for a year. She made me promise to hold no
communication with her during that time, and agreed that if we were
still of the same mind when they came back, she would withdraw the
opposition and let us be properly engaged.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>An announcement in the <i>Morning Post</i> and all that sort of thing?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I suppose so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>And when are they coming back?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>They came back last week. But I haven’t had a chance of speaking to
Nellie yet. The year is up to-day, and this morning I had a note from
Lady Sellenger asking if they might come to tea.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>And what are you going to say to her?<a name="page_32" id="page_32"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens! What can I say? I was poor enough a year ago, but now I’m
penniless. I’m bound to ask for my release.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Then why on earth have you been trying to make me utterly miserable?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You know, I don’t want to seem an awful prig, but I don’t think I should
much like doing anything shabby. If Nellie wants me to keep my promise I
shan’t draw back.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but she won’t. She’ll be only too glad to get rid of you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid there’s something else I must tell you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>More? Don’t say you’ve got a horrible past, because I shan’t turn a
hair.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>No, it’s not that. You know that Lord Hollington is a relation of mine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Only a fifteenth cousin, isn’t he? Far too distant to brag about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>A year ago three lives stood between me and the<a name="page_33" id="page_33"></a> peerage. It seemed
impossible that I could ever come into anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>But last winter my cousin George unfortunately broke his neck in the
hunting-field, and his poor old father died of the shock. If anything
happened to my cousin Charles everything would come to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>And Lady Sellenger would doubtless withdraw her opposition to your
marriage.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>She’s a very nice woman, but she has rather a keen eye for the main
chance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Even her best friend would hesitate to call her disinterested. But why
should anything happen to Lord Hollington? He’s quite young, isn’t he? I
saw his engagement announced in the <i>Morning Post</i> a little while ago.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>He’s out in India at this moment. He’s a soldier, you know. It appears
there’s some trouble on the North-West Frontier, and he’s in command of
the expedition.<a name="page_34" id="page_34"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but nothing is going to happen to him. He’ll live till he’s eighty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure I hope he will.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Say again that you love me, Gerald.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I oughtn’t to yet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You know, you’ve got to marry me. I insist upon it. After all, you’ve
been trifling with my affections shamefully. Oh, we shall be so happy,
Gerald. And we’ll never grow any older than we are now. You know, I’m an
awfully good sort, really. I talk a lot of nonsense, but I don’t mean
it. I very seldom listen to it myself. I’m sick of society. I want to
settle down and be domesticated. I’ll sit at home and darn your socks.
And I shall hate it, and I shall be so happy. And if you want to be
independent you can have a job at the brewery. We want a smart energetic
man to keep us up to the times. And we’ll have a lovely box at the
opera, and you can always get away for the shooting.</p>

things.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>It advertises the beer, don’t you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>I wish I could drink it, Mrs. Worthley, but it’s so fattening. I
understand you always have it on your table.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I think that’s the least I can do, as it’s only on account of the beer

<p>[<i>Lightly.</i>] What are you going to say to me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Now do sit down. And look as if you were talking of the weather.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>It’s a little difficult to discuss the matter quite indifferently.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>My dear boy, it’s the little difficulties of life which prevent it from
being dull. We should be no better<a name="page_39" id="page_39"></a> than the beasts of the field if we
had no anxieties about our soul and our position in society.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I see.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather impatiently.</i>] My dear Gerald, why don’t you help me? What I
have to say is so very unpleasant. You know I have always had a most
sincere affection for you. Under other circumstances I would have wanted
no better son-in-law.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>It’s very kind of you to say so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>I’ve assured you for the last three years that a marriage was absurd,
and now I want to tell you that it’s impossible. Love is all very well
in its way, but it doesn’t make up for a shabby house in the suburbs.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You’re not romantic, Lady Sellenger.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>My dear, when you reach my age you’ll agree with me that it’s only the
matter of fact which really signifies. Love in a cottage is a delusion
of youth. It’s difficult enough after ten years of solid matrimony in
Grosvenor Square.<a name="page_40" id="page_40"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You married for love, Lady Sellenger.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>I’m anxious that my daughter shouldn’t make the same mistake. Now let us
be quite frank with one another.... Are you sure they’re not listening?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Glancing at the others.</i>] They seem very much occupied with their own
affairs. What is your ultimatum?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Well, Gerald, I’m not in the least mercenary. I know that money can’t
give happiness. But I do feel that unless you have at least two thousand
a year you can’t make my daughter even comfortable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure that’s very modest.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>It’s not love in a cottage. It’s not love in a palace. It’s
just&mdash;matrimony in Onslow Gardens.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I may as well tell you at once that I’ve had very bad luck. I wanted to
make money, and I’ve come an absolute cropper.<a name="page_41" id="page_41"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>My dear Gerald, I’m very sorry. Is it as bad as all that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>It couldn’t be much worse.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Dear me, that’s very sad. But, of course, it simplifies matters, doesn’t
it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Enormously. It puts marriage entirely out of the question and leaves
only one course open to me. I’ll take the earliest opportunity to ask
Nellie for my release.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>What a pity it is you’re so poor! Your principles are really excellent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>But what about Nellie? How will she take it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>She’s so reserved, poor dear! She never speaks of her feelings. But
after three London seasons most girls have learnt to bow to the
inevitable. And how is Lord Hollington?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>He’s to be married as soon as he comes back from India.<a name="page_42" id="page_42"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>It was dreadfully sad that his uncle and his cousin should die within a
year. If anything happened to him you’d be in very different
circumstances. But, of course, it would be wicked to wish it. I hope you
never do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Never. I trust he’ll live to a hundred.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>And I daresay he’ll have fifteen children. Those delicate men often
do.... Why don’t you speak to Nellie now and get it over?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>This very minute? With others in the room?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>That’s just it, I want to give neither of you any opportunity for
sentiment.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You’re certainly very practical.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>No woman can afford to be sentimental when she has a marriageable
daughter.... For heaven’s sake don’t make Nellie cry, we’re dining out
to-night.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’ll do my best to be very matter of fact.<a name="page_43" id="page_43"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Raising her voice.</i>] Mr. Blenkinsop, I want to quarrel with you!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming forward.</i>] You fill me with consternation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>You passed us in Pall Mall this afternoon and you cut us dead.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I’m so sorry, I didn’t see you. I’d just been to the War Office to

Halstane, isn’t Hollington a relation of yours?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Yes, why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Listen, there’s the last edition coming along.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>But what is it, Mr. Blenkinsop?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>A small force was sent out to punish some local people up in the hills,
who’d been making themselves troublesome, and it hasn’t been heard of
since. The idea is that there may have been some trouble and they’ve all
got cut up.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But how does it concern Lord Hollington?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Good God!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>When I was there a couple of hours ago the War Office had no news at
all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>But why didn’t you tell me about it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I thought you knew. I’d forgotten for the moment<a name="page_45" id="page_45"></a> that Hollington had
anything to do with you. He’s a very distant relation, isn’t he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I hardly know him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p>The news has come just an hour too soon. It’s bound me hand and foot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean by that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Nellie accepted me when I was poor and of no account. Now that I’m well
off I can’t go to her and say: I’ve changed my mind and don’t want to
marry you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean by being well off?<a name="page_51" id="page_51"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I believe I shall have six or seven thousand a year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But you can’t live on that. It’s absurd.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] There are people who live on much less, you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Besides, she doesn’t care for you in the least. I could see that at a
glance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>How?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>A girl who loved you wouldn’t have a skirt cut like that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I can’t draw back now, Dot. You must see that I can’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>If you cared for me, you’d easily find some way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I must be honest, Dot.... I don’t want to seem a snob, but I’ve got an
ancient name, and it’s<a name="page_52" id="page_52"></a> rather honourable. I’m by way of being the head
of the family now. I don’t want to begin by acting like a cad.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You know, I’m much nicer than Nellie. I’m more amusing, and I’m better
dressed, and I’ve got five motor cars. It’s true she’s younger than I
am, but I don’t feel a day more than seventeen. [<i>With a little look at
him.</i>] And if you had any sense of decency at all you’d say I looked it.
You said you loved me just now. Say it again, Gerald. It’s so good to
hear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I don’t see how we can help ourselves.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Beginning to lose her temper.</i>] I suppose you just want to finish an
awkward scene? I don’t want to harrow you. Why don’t you go to the War
Office?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You must see it’s not my fault. If we must part, let us part friends.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Now, I declare he wants to sentimentalise. Isn’t it enough that you’ve
made me frightfully unhappy? D’you want me to say it doesn’t matter at
all, as if you’d spilt a cup of tea on me? D’you think I like being
utterly wretched?<a name="page_53" id="page_53"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>For heaven’s sake, don’t talk like that. You’re tearing my heart to
pieces.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p><i>Your</i> heart? I should like to bang it on the floor and stamp on it. You
must expect to suffer a little. You can’t put it all on me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I don’t want you to suffer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In a temper.</i>] You were willing enough to marry me when you hadn’t got
sixpence to bless yourself with. How fortunate your cousin didn’t die a
week later!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Do you think I was proposing to marry you for your money?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

with a clever knave than an honest fool.</p>

<p>I’m in a temper.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>That must be obvious to the meanest intelligence.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Have you read the paper to-day?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>I’ve tried to, but as you’ve spent most of the<a name="page_58" id="page_58"></a> morning in stamping on
it, I haven’t had much success.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Then I beg you to listen to this: [<i>Taking up a “Morning Post” and
reading it.</i>] A marriage has been arranged between Lord Hollington and
Eleanor, only daughter of the late General Sir Robert Sellenger.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She crumples up the paper and stamps on it.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>That’s the twenty-third time you’ve read this announcement to me. I
assure you that it’s beginning to lose its novelty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You can’t deny that it’s rather annoying to take up your paper in the
morning and discover an official announcement that the man you’ve made
up your mind to marry is taking serious steps to marry somebody else.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>But would you tell me why you want to marry him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Why does anybody ever want to marry anybody?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>That is a question to which during the fifty-five years of my life I’ve
been totally unable to discover an answer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, because he’s clever, and handsome, and amusing.<a name="page_59" id="page_59"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>He’s not really very clever, you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Of course he isn’t. He’s as stupid as an owl. I’ve told him so till I’m
blue in the face.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>And he’s not really very good-looking, is he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>On the contrary, I think he’s rather plain.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>I suppose you find him amusing?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Not at all. I find him dull.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>Then, perhaps, you can find me some other explanation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’m head over ears in love with him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>But why, my dear? Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Because I am. That’s the most conclusive reason possible. And I’ve set
my heart on marrying him.<a name="page_60" id="page_60"></a> And the more obstacles there are the more I
mean to marry him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>I can’t imagine why you hadn’t the sense to fall in love with one of the
various eligible persons who want to marry you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But he <i>does</i> want to marry me. He’s desperately in love with me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>I should have thought he could find a better way of showing it than by
getting engaged to somebody else.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>He’s a sentimentalist, like all his sex. Good heavens, what a mess the
world would get into if it weren’t for the practical common sense of the
average women.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>And what do you propose to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>That’s just it. I don’t in the least know. They’ll all be here in half
an hour, and I haven’t the shadow of a scheme. I lie awake all night
racking my brains, and I can’t think of anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>Why did you ask them to come here?<a name="page_61" id="page_61"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I thought I might hit upon something if they were under my eyes. Gerald
had promised to spend Whitsun with me and, so that he shouldn’t put me
off, I asked the Sellengers, too. Lady Sellenger was only too glad to
get a week’s board and lodging for nothing. [<i>The sound is heard of a
motor stopping.</i>] There’s Jimmie Blenkinsop. I told you he was going to
motor down in time for luncheon, didn’t I? [<span class="smcap">Blenkinsop</span> <i>comes in with</i>
<span class="smcap">Freddie</span>. <span class="smcap">Freddie</span> <i>has on a gay tweed suit</i>.] Jimmie!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>How d’you do?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He shakes hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza</span>.</p></div>

<p>Now we’ll have luncheon. You must be starving with hunger.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You must let me wash first.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>No, we’re all far too hungry. Freddie will go and wash his hands for
you.</p>

<p>I perceive that the tender passion hasn’t in the least interfered with
your appetite.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear James, I’m so unhappy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You look it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>By the way, how do I look?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>All right. You’ve changed your cook.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Hang my cook.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I wouldn’t if I were you. She’s very good.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Of course you’ll drink the family ale?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Of course I’ll do nothing of the kind.<a name="page_63" id="page_63"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You know it’s one of my principles to have it on the table.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Yes, but it’s one of my principles not to drink it. I seem to remember
that you have some particularly fine hock.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Jimmie, have you never been in love?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Never, thank God.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I don’t believe it. Every one’s in love. I’m in love.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Not with me, I trust.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You perfect idiot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Not at all. I should think it very natural.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I wonder why you never married, James.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Because I have a considerable gift for repartee. I discovered in my
early youth that men propose not because they want to marry, but because
on certain<a name="page_64" id="page_64"></a> occasions they are entirely at a loss for topics of
conversation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] It was a momentous discovery.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>No sooner had I made it than I began to cultivate my power of small
talk. I felt that my only chance was to be ready with appropriate
subjects at the shortest notice, and I spent a considerable part of my
last year at Oxford in studying the best masters.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I never noticed that you were particularly brilliant.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I never played for brilliancy. I played for safety. I flatter myself
that when prattle was needed I have never been found wanting. I have met
the ingenuity of sweet seventeen with a few observations on Free Trade,
while the haggard efforts of thirty have struggled in vain against a
brief exposition of the higher philosophy. The skittish widow of
uncertain age has retired in disorder before a complete acquaintance
with the restoration dramatists, and I have routed the serious spinster
with religious leanings by my remarkable knowledge of the results of
missionary endeavour in Central Africa. Once a dowager sought to ask me
my intentions, but I flung at her astonished head an entire article from
the “Encyclopædia Britannica.” These are only my serious efforts. I need
not tell you how often I have<a name="page_65" id="page_65"></a> evaded a flash of the eyes by an epigram
or ignored a sigh by an apt quotation from the poets.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I don’t believe a word you say. I believe you never married for the
simple reason that nobody would have you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Do me the justice to acknowledge that I’m the only man who’s known you
ten days without being tempted by your preposterous income to offer you
his hand and heart.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I don’t believe my income has anything to do with it. I put it down
entirely to my very considerable personal attractions.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>Here is Freddie, at last. What has he been doing?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Freddie</span> <i>comes in, having changed into flannels</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Why on earth have you changed your clothes?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sitting down at table.</i>] I regard it as part of my duties as your
secretary to look nice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know that I think it essential for you to put on seven different
suits a day.<a name="page_66" id="page_66"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I thought Miss Sellenger would probably like to go on the river before
tea.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>If she does, it’s more likely to be with Lord Hollington than with you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that’s rot. Gerald’s an awfully good sort, but he’s not the sort of
chap a girl’s desperately fond of.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You think that, do you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Well, you can’t see yourself falling in love with him can you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>No. No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>And what is the sort of man a girl’s desperately fond of?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I don’t know. [<i>Taking up a spoon and looking at himself, twisting
an infinitesimal moustache.</i>] I should think some one a bit younger than
Gerald.</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Not positively.</p>

to mention.<a name="page_68" id="page_68"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Rubbish!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I daresay he can whisper nonsense in a woman’s ear as well as any one
else.</p>

<p>It’s born in them, the brutes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Pooh! I wouldn’t waste my time on whispering nonsense. I’d just send my

<p>You’ve only seen her once.</p>

<p>You’re the most cynical man in London, and I’m frightened to death of
you.</p>

<p>There’s nothing the world loves more than a ready-made description which
they can hang on to a man, and so save themselves all trouble in future.
When I was quite young it occurred to some one that I was a cynic, and
since then I’ve never been able to remark that it was a fine day without
being accused of odious cynicism.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>My dear Mr. Blenkinsop, what every one says is<a name="page_73" id="page_73"></a> always true. That is one

penniless young man who married a very rich woman old enough to be his
mother to be genuinely in love with her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I’m not making you a proposal of marriage, idiot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Then I should very much like to know what you are doing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I’m asking you a very simple and ordinary question.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Thank God, it’s not one that women ask often.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I never saw any one out of whom it’s harder to get a straight answer.<a name="page_77" id="page_77"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You must make allowances for a pardonable agitation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>James, do you want to marry me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>No, bless you!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Are you quite sure?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Positive.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Would nothing induce you to marry me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sigh of relief.</i>] Then you may kiss my hand.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Doing so.</i>] You’re not hurt?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I’m infinitely relieved.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>And Freddie, the dear boy, says he can read a woman at a glance.<a name="page_78" id="page_78"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Now listen to me quite seriously. I want you to do something for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Nervously.</i>] We’ve put marriage out of the question, haven’t we?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Generously.</i>] You may ask anything else of me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I want you to let me make love to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>My dear friend, this is very surprising.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>There are people who’d welcome the proposal with alacrity.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>For how long?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Only for a week.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You’re sure it’s not in earnest?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Quite sure.<a name="page_79" id="page_79"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>And what have I got to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, you’ve got to look as if you liked it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sombrely.</i>] Of course, it sounds very delightful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You must show a coming-on disposition, you know, or I can do nothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Do you want me to make love to <i>you</i>?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid it’s asking a great deal of you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Not at all. Not at all. But I wish you’d tell me what your little game
is.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Ah, here’s Aunt Eliza. The very person I wanted. [<span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza</span> <i>comes on
the terrace from the house. Impulsively.</i>] Aunt Eliza, will you be a
perfect brick? Will you do something for me, that’s an awful nuisance?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>My dear, why on earth are you so excited? Of course I’ll do anything in
reason for you.<a name="page_80" id="page_80"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But it’s not in reason.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’ll do it all the same.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I want you to take a motor and bolt up to London and get a special
licence.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>A special licence!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>A special licence!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Catching sight of his face.</i>] Get two special licences. They’re always
useful things to have in a house.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>But they must be made out to certain names.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Must they? How stupid! Well, have one made out for Frederick Perkins and
Eleanor Sellenger.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>My dear child, you must be crazy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Now don’t argue, but do as I tell you. If two<a name="page_81" id="page_81"></a> young things are thrown
together with a certain amount of skill they always marry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>But they hardly know one another.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>If people waited to know one another before they married, the world
wouldn’t be so grossly over-populated as it is now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>You’re certainly quite crazy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>No, I’m not. I shall never get Gerald to break his word. My only chance
is with Nellie.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Uneasily.</i>] But you’ve told her to get two licences.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Make the second one out in the names of James Blenkinsop and Frances
Annandale Worthley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I absolutely refuse.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But you must let me. You can’t leave an old friend in the lurch.<a name="page_82" id="page_82"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>It’s all very fine to invoke the claims of friendship, but it’s carrying
it rather far when you pay three guineas for a special licence.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My dear man, I can’t drag you to the altar.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I’m beginning to think you’re capable of anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But don’t you see, you idiot, that I want to marry Gerald Hollington?
And I’m eating my heart out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Crossly.</i>] It’s evidently a diet that agrees with you. You’re growing
fat on it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be spiteful. I’ve not gained half a pound in the last five years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>And how on earth are you going to get Freddie and Nellie Sellenger to
use this licence?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Never mind, leave everything to me. And make haste to get up to London.<a name="page_83" id="page_83"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza.</span></p>

<p>Very well, I’ll go at once.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>Just as</i> <span class="smcap">Aunt Eliza</span> <i>is going into the house</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger</span>

the conversation from the doorway</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I hope you’ve found everything you wanted.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, thanks. I’m quite delighted with the view from my room.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Come and sit down. I have something very serious I want to talk to you
about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Dear Mr. Blenkinsop, do take Nellie for a little stroll in the garden.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but it concerns Nellie, and I want her to hear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I perceive you are inclined to think that the serious cannot fail to be
improper, Lady Sellenger.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Be quiet, you horrible cynic.<a name="page_84" id="page_84"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, a most ridiculous thing has happened, and I want Nellie to help
me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>Me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My dear, it’s so unfortunate, but my nephew has fallen head over ears in
love with you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I can’t understand it. After all, he’s only seen you once, and you can’t
have exchanged more than a dozen words.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>How very annoying!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>And it’s so unexpected, because he’s not at all the sort of boy who
falls in and out of love with every pretty girl he meets. I think you’re
his first passion, and he’s inclined to take it very seriously.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Poor boy, I can afford to sympathise with him now that Nellie is safely
engaged to Gerald Hollington.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>It’s really rather flattering, isn’t it? But how on earth d’you know?<a name="page_85" id="page_85"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>He tells me everything. You see I’ve always tried to be his friend as
well as his aunt. He has no secrets from me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You’ll tell us next that a boy who’s been to Eton and Oxford has a pure
and innocent mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My dear child, he simply raves about you. He’s been talking of nothing
else ever since you met.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>But doesn’t he know that Nellie is going to be married at the end of the
season?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Of course, he does. I’ve dinned it into his ears, but it seems to have
no effect on him. He’s the sort of lover that will hear of no obstacles.
It’s really quite pathetic to hear the passionate harangues that he
pours into my ears.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>What sort of things does he say?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I suppose very much the same as Gerald.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>No one could accuse Gerald of being a passionate lover.<a name="page_86" id="page_86"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>I’m very glad he’s not. He’s going to be your husband, and that’s more
satisfactory than any amount of pretty speeches.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I could wish that he talked to me of something besides the weather and
the Royal Academy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>My dear child, what are you saying? Gerald has a charming nature and the
very highest principles.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Imitating her pompous manner.</i>] To say nothing of a peerage and a
considerable income.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>He certainly has every advantage over poor Freddie, who is nobody in
particular and hasn’t a penny to bless himself with.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I think he’s awfully nice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, that’s just what I don’t want you to think. I shouldn’t have said
anything to you about his&mdash;mad infatuation, only I want you to be very
careful.<a name="page_87" id="page_87"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Of course. It’s quite natural.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>What do you want me to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, I want you to be very good and sweet and help me to cure him. I’d
send him away, only it would have no effect. I thought if he saw you
again he might find out that you have at least one or two faults. At
present he thinks you too perfect for words.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I’m not that, really.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t think you were. I want you to promise that you’ll do nothing
that he can in the least take as encouragement. I want you to be very
distant and very cold.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>Of course, I’ll be only too glad to do anything I can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You’d be doing him a real kindness if you could snub him at every
opportunity. Then you must avoid him as much as you can. Of course,
you’ll be very much with Gerald while you’re down here.<a name="page_88" id="page_88"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Of course. The dears, they’ve not seen one another for a year, and they
have an infinity of things to discuss.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>It’ll be quite easy for you to show my poor Freddie that he’s only
making a prodigious fool of himself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I feel so sorry for him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You will do what you can, won’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I’ll make it quite plain to him at once that he mustn’t care for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Treat it as an impertinence that you resent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I’ll do that on the first opportunity.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I know you have the sweetest nature in the world, but if you could be
really brutal to him at once, it would cure him instantly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I can be horrid when I like.<a name="page_89" id="page_89"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure you can. I put infinite reliance in your tact.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>And now I think we really might take a little turn in the garden before
tea. [<i>Seeing that</i> <span class="smcap">Nellie</span>, <i>instead of accompanying her, strolls
towards the house</i>.] Where are you going, Nellie?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Stopping.</i>] I’ve just remembered I must write a letter. I’ll join you

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Blenkinsop</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot</span> <i>who are getting up</i>.] Oh, don’t let me

<p>I shall do nothing of the sort. I shall put it in my button-hole.<a name="page_90" id="page_90"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Freddie, I’ve come to the conclusion that you want a holiday. I wish you
to pack up your things at once and go to Brighton for a week. You’re
looking pale and tired. I’m sure you’ve been working too hard.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, rot! I’m as fit as a fiddle.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you agree with me, James?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Certainly. I think a change of air is distinctly indicated.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>But I can’t go away when you’ve got people in the house. Besides, who’s
to look after your correspondence?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My dear boy, your health is the chief thing. I should never forgive
myself if you came to any harm while you were my secretary. I’ll write
my letters myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Besides, I shall be here, and I’ll do all I can to help you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t believe I’m pale.<a name="page_91" id="page_91"></a></p>

<p>Look here, there’s something behind this.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You’re too clever, my boy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I see through your little game. Aunt Dot, you want to get rid of me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>How can you be so absurd?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Shall we tell him the truth?</p>

<p>Yes, perhaps you’d better. He’s a very bright boy.<a name="page_92" id="page_92"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, the fact is, Freddie, a dreadful thing has happened. Poor Nellie
Sellenger is desperately in love with you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t see why you should want me to go away on that account.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Good lord, man, don’t be so self-satisfied. Aren’t you surprised, aren’t
you dumfounded that a pretty girl should fall in love with you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I thought it meant something when she dropped that rose.</p>

<p>Bless my stars, the dolt takes it as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I’m awfully flattered and all that sort of thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But not exactly surprised?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>It’s not fair to ask a fellow a question like that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>At all events, you see now the necessity for depriving us for a time of
your charming society.<a name="page_93" id="page_93"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Nothing will induce me to desert a post of danger. I’m going to face the
music.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be such an ass. It’s not you we’re thinking of, it’s that
unfortunate girl.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know why you think she’s unfortunate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But, my dear boy, she’s engaged to Gerald Hollington. Don’t you see how
serious the whole thing is? The only chance is for you to go away. We
must try and make her forget you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t want to do anybody a bad turn. I wouldn’t do anything to queer
Gerald’s pitch for worlds.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You must combine with us in order to save her from herself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>There’s no use in her eating her heart out for you, when she must
inevitably marry Gerald.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Poor old Gerald, I told you he wasn’t the sort of chap a girl would be
desperately in love with.<a name="page_94" id="page_94"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>The acumen you have shown does credit to your years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Still, you know, I don’t think it’s wise for me to go away. Don’t you
think it would be rather marked? And they always say that absence makes
the heart grow fonder.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>It was a woman who invented that proverb. There’s no truth in it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>What else can you suggest? The fact remains that Nellie must be cured of
this&mdash;of this passion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>My own idea is that the best thing is for me to hang on here as if I
knew nothing about it. I’ll take care to be very distant. I’ll ignore
her as much as I can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Will you promise to do that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Yes, rather. I’ll let her see that I’m really a deuced dissipated dog.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Don’t let her think you’re too great a devil with<a name="page_95" id="page_95"></a> the ladies, or
that’ll be the last straw. If there’s one thing a woman likes it’s a
really bad man. She’ll start reforming you, and then there’ll be no
holding her back.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>No, you must seem rather dull and stupid. Let her think you’re a bit of
a milksop.</p>

<p>Have you never been loved for yourself, Mr. Blenkinsop?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I have, but I have always found it deuced expensive.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid Blenkinsop doesn’t set much store on the gentle sex.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Don’t call them gentle. They’re very much rougher than men.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Stop him, or he’ll utter a whole string of horrors.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Have you never watched the gentle sex fight and push and scramble as it
gets into the Hammersmith bus? I assure you, the unlucky man who finds
himself in that seething feminine crowd is fortunate if he escapes
without losing an eye or half his teeth. And have you seen the fury of
the gentle sex at a sale as they seize some worthless fragment, and the
bitterness with which they haggle? The other day I was in the Army and
Navy Stores, and two women were standing on the stairs, discussing their
servants, so that no one could pass up and down. I took off my<a name="page_98" id="page_98"></a> hat and
said: Excuse me, would you allow me to pass. They moved barely two
inches, and one of them said in a loud voice to the other: What an
impertinent man. The gentle sex! Yesterday I was hanging on a strap in a
crowded train coming from the city, and I saw a pale-faced weary clerk
give up his seat to a strong and bouncing girl. She took it without
saying thank you, because she was a lady and he wasn’t a gentleman. Then
a tired old woman came in and stood, but the bouncing girl never thought
of giving up the seat to her. The gentle sex! They have such tender
hearts they couldn’t bear to hurt a fly. Have you ever seen a woman get
out of a bus ten yards before her destination in order to save the
wretched horses another start? Not much. Have you ever known a woman of
fashion who sends her maid to bed when she knows she won’t be in till
four in the morning? Not much. And is there anything like the insolence
with which a woman treats her social inferiors of the same sex? Is it
men who put on their backs the sealskins that are torn off the living
bodies of helpless brutes? Is it men who put on their hats the beautiful
birds of the forest? It’s the gentle sex. Boys are taught manners. They
are taught to take off their hats and hold open the door for their
sisters. They are taught to fetch and carry for women, and to give up
the front seat in life to women. But what are girls taught? Girls are
taught etiquette, and that, I suppose, makes them in due course the
gentle sex.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>By the way, are you by any chance in love with me now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>You have no right to ask me that question.<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My dear boy, I’m not keeping you from spending an idyllic afternoon with
Nellie. You’ve forced this conversation upon me. I assure you it’s most
distasteful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>If I had married you, I should certainly have beaten you with a big
stick.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>What do you think is my chief characteristic?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>That’s a question I <i>can</i> answer. The most confounded and aggravating
unreasonableness that I ever saw.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense. It’s obvious that my chief characteristic is a sweet and
yielding nature. But as there’s no likelihood of our agreeing on that,
what do you think is the second?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Obstinacy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Well, I prefer to call it strength of mind. Now, I’ll acknowledge that I
was in love with you&mdash;a month ago. That’s a feather in your cap.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I wish we were back again. I’ve had such rotten luck.<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But when I saw that my sweetness was likely to be wasted on the desert
air, I made up my mind to cure myself. First I cried for two days.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Dot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>No, don’t sympathise. I have rather a high colour, and when I’ve had a
good cry it always improves my complexion. After that, I ordered some
new frocks, and I bought a diamond necklace that I’d been hankering
after for some time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>And that thoroughly consoled you, I suppose?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>It helped. Then I came to the conclusion that there were as good fish in
the sea as ever came out of it. I thought you over. After all, you’re
not really very good-looking, are you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I’m not aware that I ever made any pretence of being so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>And I’m sure no one could accuse you of being extremely amusing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I have no doubt I’m excessively dull.<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I couldn’t help seeing that you’d suit Nellie much better than you would
have suited me. She has that comfortable stupidity which the average
Englishman looks upon as the highest recommendation for a wife.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>It’s charming of you to say so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>She <i>is</i> a little dull, isn’t she?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think her so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Doesn’t time hang rather heavily on your hands now and then? Isn’t it
difficult to find topics of conversation?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I don’t find it so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Ah&mdash;she does.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>And the long and short of it is that the emotion which you dignify with
the name of love, had entirely disappeared after a week.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Make it ten days to be on the safe side.<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I congratulate you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You wouldn’t have it otherwise, surely?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Then all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Furiously.</i>] I think you must be quite heartless.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Delighted.</i>] Ah, that’s what I said to you a month ago, Philippine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Now, perhaps, you’d like to know what my feeling is towards you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>No, I’m quite indifferent, thanks!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Well, I shall tell you for all that. It’s a joke to you, and you can

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I should think about fifteen thousand.</p>

<p>Every girl likes a suspicion of romance thrown over her love-affairs.</p>

get perilously near a squabble?<a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I sometimes think it would be better to quarrel outright now and then
than be always so desperately polite to one another.</p>

<p>We spent the whole afternoon on the river yesterday, and you kindly gave
us our tea to take with us.</p>

life, and I must really go and lie down.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

put you right.</p>

earned a husband, I have. I’ve taken every opportunity to snub Gerald

Nellie’s company till they’re both so bored they could almost cry. I’ve
been constantly on the watch to prevent Nellie and Freddie from having
two minutes by themselves till they can hardly bear the sight of me. And
I’ve made love to you with a persistence that would have melted the

<p>[<i>Sobbing in her handkerchief.</i>] Yes, it has. I’m sick to death of the
whole thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You asked me to play a part, and you didn’t know that it might be deadly
earnest.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Fiddlesticks!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I have a secret that I can no longer keep from you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don’t be so silly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>But I tell you I’m not joking.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Thank heaven for that. I’m weary of your bad jokes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>The thing started as a bad joke, but it has ended in something very
different. A change has come over me, and I’m ashamed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking up.</i>] Eh?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I really believe he’s waking up.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>If I was shy and awkward, it’s because I wouldn’t give in to myself. I

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>That’s much better. There really is a ring of emotion in your voice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>How shouldn’t there be, when I’m saying at last what has trembled on the
tip of my tongue for ten days?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Delighted.</i>] There! That’s just the tone I want. Talk with that quiver
in your voice when you ask me to pass you the mustard at dinner.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I lie awake at night thinking of you, and when I fall asleep I seem to
hold you in my arms.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>That’s splendid. Why couldn’t you say all this before?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Dot, Dot, don’t torture me. Don’t you see I mean it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>What!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I’m not jesting now. I wish to heaven I were.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You must be mad or blind. Can’t you feel that I love you?</p>

<p>Don’t be so absurd. You know you’re only&mdash;you’re only pulling my leg.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I’ve been a perfect ass. I should never have consented to play this

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Upon my soul, it looks very much like it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>What did you expect? You’ve played on my heart-strings as though they
were an instrument that had no feeling. You’ve put a caress into every
tone of your voice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ruefully.</i>] Of course, I am fascinating. I can’t deny that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>When you touched my hand, every nerve of my body thrilled.<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You’re not really in love with me?</p>

<p>You’re ridiculous, James Blenkinsop.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I was a fool. I played with fire, and I never dreamed I’d burn myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But you mustn’t be in love with me. I won’t hear of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>It’s too late to say that now. I adore you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But what on earth’s to be done?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You must marry me.</p>

let a trifling engagement with somebody else stand in the way?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>The fact is that men are never to be trusted.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I can’t live without you now. I’ll give up my whole life to make you

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But I’m in love with Gerald. I’m not in love with you. I shall never be

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You owe me something for all the agony you’ve made me endure. Dot,

Canterbury was in earnest.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

inflames the chaste breasts of yourself and Miss Sellenger, should
attack the equally chaste breasts of myself and Mrs. Worthley.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>My dear Dot, much as I appreciate the beauty of your sentiments, I must
confess that I could never marry a woman who did not love me.<a name="page_142" id="page_142"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As though she were struggling with her modesty.</i>] I see that you want
to force from me the avowal that is so hard to make. Oh, you men!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Good God, you don’t mean to say you’re in love with me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Languishing.</i>] James. Is it so very wonderful?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Half an hour ago you said you couldn’t stand me at any price.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>It’s a woman’s privilege to change her mind. The passion which you threw
into your proposal has completely changed me. I am touched by the
vehemence with which you flung your heart at my feet. I have struggled,
but I cannot resist. Take me in your arms, James, and never let me go.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Dot, I have a confession to make to you. I didn’t mean a word I said.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Ah, James, do not jest.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I assure you I’m perfectly serious. You taunted<a name="page_143" id="page_143"></a> me that I couldn’t make
love, so I just let myself go to show you I could. I daresay it was a
silly joke, but it certainly was a joke.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Unmoved.</i>] James, every word you say increases my admiration for you.
I can’t think now how I was ever blind to your great affection.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>But don’t you hear what I say?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Do you think you can take me in so easily?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You don’t believe me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Not a word.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Thoroughly alarmed.</i>] Now, look here. I don’t love you, I’ve never
loved you, and I never shall love you. I can’t put it any clearer than
that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With rapture.</i>] God, how he adores me!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I say, look here, this is a bit too thick.<a name="page_144" id="page_144"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I know you only say these cruel things because you think I should be
throwing myself away on you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Huffily.</i>] I don’t know about that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You cannot bear to think that I should accept you from pity. But it
isn’t that, James. You are handsome and noble and chivalrous. How
shouldn’t a woman love you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I repeat that I do not reciprocate your passion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You can’t deceive me so easily as that, James. I <i>know</i> you love me. We
women have such quick intuitions.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>So you always say.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I see you simply quivering with restrained emotion. Oh, James, James,
you’ve made me so happy.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She flings herself on his bosom and pretends to burst into

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I should like all the world to see us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>But it’s devilish compromising.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I want to compromise myself. Only thus can I make you certain of my
love. Oh, think of the many happy years we shall spend in one another’s
arms, James.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Extricating himself from her embrace.</i>] Is there nothing I can say to

<p>Nothing! I am yours till death.</p>

<p>I say, I wish you’d just have a look at these letters.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes. I want to have a little talk with you, Freddie. [<i>She takes one
of the letters and reads.</i>] “I am directed by Mrs. Worthley to
congratulate you on the recent addition to your family, but to express
her regret that she cannot accede to your request.” How brutal you are,
Freddie! Surely Mrs. Murphy is an old friend.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I looked her out in my note-book. Six months ago we sent her fifteen
pounds because she had nine children. Now she has eleven.<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>And yet they complain that the birth-rate is falling. I think we’d
better send her five pounds.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>You really can’t encourage a woman who has twins twice a year, when her
husband is not only bed-ridden but a hopeless lunatic.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps she <i>is</i> a little prolific.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>Here is my answer to Mrs. MacTavish, who wants help to bury a husband.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Poor thing! You’d better send her ten pounds.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>I’ve answered: “Madam, I regret to see that this is the third time you
have lost your husband within two years. The mortality among the unhappy
gentlemen on whom you bestow your hand is so great that I can only
recommend you in future to remain a widow. Yours faithfully, Frederick
Perkins.”</p>

original, Freddie.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

poor Nellie’s affection for you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] I’ve tried to do my duty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I know. And in recognition of this I want you to accept a little
present. Where is my cheque-book?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Producing it promptly.</i>] Oh, no, really, I shouldn’t like you to do
anything of the sort. [<i>Putting it in front of her, and giving her a
pen.</i>] I feel that I’m amply paid for all that I do for you. I simply
can’t accept anything more.</p>

<p>Aren’t you? I suppose you know that when you do, I’m proposing to give
you two thousand a year.</p>

<p>I can’t think what you ever saw in him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I was never really fond of him, you know. I only<a name="page_153" id="page_153"></a> accepted him because
he was so desperately in love with me, and mamma wouldn’t hear of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Freddie.</span></p>

<p>When did you first know that you cared for me?</p>

<p>Nellie, my love, I’ve been discussing a very important matter with
Gerald.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I know. You asked him to name the day.<a name="page_159" id="page_159"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>I feel that I have no right to restrain any longer the very natural
impatience of these young things.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Aghast.</i>] And what did Gerald say?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>He wishes to leave it entirely to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure that’s very obliging of him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Of course, he’s all eagerness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Grimly.</i>] Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Nellie.</span></p>

<p>I would much sooner&mdash;let Gerald fix it at his own convenience.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>I think it’s delightful, the way they give in to one another.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>We shall only bore Mrs. Dot if we discuss the matter now.<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a></p>

<p>We’re all old friends here. I’m sure Mrs. Dot will help us with her
advice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>My own opinion is, that in these matters the sooner the better.</p>

<p>When you have to take a pill the best thing is to swallow it down
without thinking.</p>

this poor young man.</p>

calm him down. Oh, my dear! You mustn’t upset yourself yet.</p>

<p>We’ll pursue them. There’s no harm done yet. We’ll catch them. I promise

me it was the fastest machine in England?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>I did say something of the sort.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>We shall catch them up. Gerald, you must drive me. I can’t trust any one
else to go fast enough.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>But you don’t know which way they’ve gone.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be so silly. Of course they’ve gone to Brighton. When people elope
they always go to Brighton.</p>

back.<a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>If a woman can’t force her daughter to marry any man she chooses, I
don’t know what the English nation is coming to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I won’t marry the girl against her will.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Fiddlededee! Of course you’ll marry her. Who is this creature she’s run
away with? Perkins! Perkins with a P. I never heard anything so
ridiculous. Do you suppose my daughter is going to be Mrs.
Perkins&mdash;Perkins with a P?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>You couldn’t very well spell it with a W could you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Hold your impudent tongue, sir!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>Now, let’s have this out and be done with it. I’m no more in love with
Nellie than she is with me, I was going to marry her because I’d
promised to, and it seemed a low down trick to draw back....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>The man’s mad. The shock has turned his brain.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>When I heard she’d bolted, I could have jumped for<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a> joy. I seem to have
awaked out of a ghastly nightmare. Nothing will induce me to try and
catch her up.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>You monster! How dare you trifle with the affections of my daughter! You
don’t mean to stand by and see her marry a man called Perkins!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Gerald.</span></p>

<p>I wouldn’t even mind if she married a man called Vere de Vere.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Sellenger.</span></p>

<p>Very well, then, the chauffeur shall drive me. You’re a heartless brute.
Perkins with a P. And penniless to boot.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>Lady Sellenger thinks she’s going in your motor, but she isn’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Starting up.</i>] What have you done to my motor?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>As soon as she talked of it, I ran to the kitchen and seized this knife
and I seized this poker.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Woman!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I’ve ripped up all the tyres, they’re simply in ribands, James.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Good Lord!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what I’ve done to the steering gear, but I know it’ll never
work again. Oh, it’s in an awful state.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>But that’s a bran-new motor. I’ve just paid eighteen hundred pounds for
it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>And so that there shouldn’t be any risk I opened the<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a> place where the
works are, and I rummaged around with the poker. I <i>think</i> I’ve smashed
everything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Oh! Oh!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He buries his head in his hands.</i></p></div>

flop, flop.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>But I’m going to race next week.</p>

<p>I don’t know how much it’ll cost to put right. You don’t mind, James, do
you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Blenkinsop.</span></p>

<p>Mind!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Dot.</span></p>

<p>You won’t let this disturb your affection for me? Remember that you’re

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
